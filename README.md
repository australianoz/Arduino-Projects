Arduino Open Source Personal and Corrected

1/ tftpaint2.ino

  Not of my doing, credits go to the author. I corrected pieces and made some additional remarks and added a wider choice  of colour scheme.
  This works wonders with a Uno R3 connnected to the TFT 2.2" LCD Shield, (shield bought from DX.com and referenced to www.mcufruit.com, came naked. Good overall product, no flaws found yet besides a dodgy alignement of the screen and backlight easily corrected with a slight push)

  Usual librairies, see the list in the sketch and I haven't changed anything (yet) to those librairies but will strive to tweak them in the coming months. Namely on the refresh rate and I/O (both analog and digital) & SD in breakboard mode.

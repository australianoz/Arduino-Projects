1/ tftpaint2.ino

  This works wonders with a Uno R3 connnected to the TFT 2.2" LCD Shield, (shield bought from DX.com and referenced to www.mcufruit.com, came naked. Good overall product, no flaws found yet)

  Usual librairies, see the list in the sketch and I haven't changed anything (yet) to those librairies but will strive to tweak them in the coming months. Namely on the refresh rate and small sketched to control the SPI and I/O (both analog and digital) & SD.

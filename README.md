  This works wonders with a Uno R3 the TFT 2.2" LCD Shield, (sheild bought from DX.com and referenced to www.mcufruit.com, came naked)

  Usual librairies, see the list in the sketch and I haven't changed anything (yet) to those librairies but will strive to tweak them in the coming months. Namely on the refresh rate and small sketched to control the SPI and I/O (both analog and digital) & SD.
